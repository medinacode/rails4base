Rest Controller
* all scaffolded controllers inherit from RestController which has default actions and views for all CRUD operations
* replace list_columns in child class to control which columns appear in index view
* replace search_columns in child class to control which columns are searched from index view
* replace show_columns in child class to control which columns are shown on show view
* extend/replace CRUD actions in child class to add functionality and/or use custom view (copy default view as base)
